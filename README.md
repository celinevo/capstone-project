# Capstone Project: CREEPY(pen)NE

With CREEPY(pen)NE you can read or write spookie scary storys! You can also spookmark your favorites to your profile page to find them faster.
If you are feeling creative, you can write your own creepypasta in the create page!
And because even the best author makes mistakes, you can edit or delete your creepypastas in your profile.
But remember!
Don't get too scared...

...but if you DO get to scared, you can check out the feel-good page!
It's a little hard to find, but I will give you a hint. Look at your profile page and search for something out of the ordinary...

## Demo (still in progress):

You can find the hosted version on Vercel: [CREEPY(pen)NE](https://capstone-project-creepypenne.vercel.app/)
